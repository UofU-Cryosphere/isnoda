# iSnoda
iSnobal installation in a local conda environment that allows for editing of:
* [AWSM](https://github.com/USDA-ARS-NWRC/awsm)
* [SMRF](https://github.com/USDA-ARS-NWRC/smrf)
* [PySnobal](https://github.com/USDA-ARS-NWRC/pysnobal)

## Conda
Contains `environment.yml` file and de/activation scripts to setup required
env variables. Also has an install script to download the above components
(plus their dependencies) and adds them to the environment in editable mode.

## Config

Backup of configuration files.

## Docs

Install instructions for:
* [IPW](https://github.com/USDA-ARS-NWRC/ipw) on Mac OS and Linux environments.  
* [basin setup](https://github.com/USDA-ARS-NWRC/basin_setup) from source on Linux.

## Notebooks

Collection of Jupyter notebooks for mostly output analysis.

## Package

[Snobedo package](package/README.md)

## Scripts

Helper scripts to download or prepare data and execute the model components.

## Snobal 1D

Example on how to run the one dimensional implementation of Snobal.

## Development

Any updates to the conda installation needs to be done on a branch with
a `conda-` prefix. This will trigger a build on Travis and verifies integrity
of changes.
